# Reveal

Reveal is an event discovery app that allows users to find events happening in their city at random, perfect for when users don't have any particular event in mind. Choose a city and event category, and start flipping through random events one by one in a Tinder-like fashion. Start revealing events you otherwise wouldn't know about!
